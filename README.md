# backpack-flags
OpenSCAD file for making little clip-on flags to put on the chest-strap adjustment rail of your deuter backpack
## printing tips
- use a brim/raft
- shouldn't need supports
- I ended up with a bunch of STLs for my two flags. Sped up slicing by using the cli of my slicer (`for i in *; do ; prusa-slicer -g $i --load ../config.ini; done;`)
